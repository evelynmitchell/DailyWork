https://eric-zhao.com/blog/sampling https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01839 Sample, Scrutinize and Scale: Effective Inference-Time Search by Scaling Verification Sampling-based search, a simple paradigm for utilizing test-time compute, involves generating multiple candidate responses and selecting the best one -- typically by having models self-verify each response for correctness. In this paper, we study the scaling trends governing sampling-based search. Among our findings is that simply scaling up a minimalist implementation of sampling-based search, using only random sampling and direct self-verification, provides a practical inference method that, for example, elevates the reasoning capabilities of Gemini v1.5 Pro above that of o1-Preview on popular benchmarks. We partially attribute the scalability of sampling-based search to a phenomenon of implicit scaling, where sampling a larger pool of responses in turn improves self-verification accuracy. We further identify two useful principles for improving self-verification capabilities with test-time compute: (1) comparing across responses provides helpful signals about the locations of errors and hallucinations, and (2) different model output styles are useful for different contexts -- chains of thought are useful for reasoning but harder to verify. We also find that, though accurate verification can be elicited, frontier models demonstrate remarkably weak out-of-box verification capabilities and introduce a benchmark to measure progress on these deficiencies. ![[Screenshot from 2025-03-17 20-20-49.png]]

IIRC Euan has some good stuff on the factor overlays in Ch 5 of his Positional Option Trading if anyone is wanting to follow up further. I think Pim van Vliet has some stuff somewhere on how low beta effect works better if you combine it with a screen for momentum too - helps with value traps probably. I would be interested in seeing how overlaying the Moontower approach helped with that, can imagine that unifying several small edges in a sensible way would help but hard to know as wonâ€™t be additive.

1. the factor approach to options absolutely works but:
    
2. _[_6:41 AM_]_
    
    1) it is really a cross-sectional effect (edited)
    
3. _[_6:41 AM_]_
    
    2) you need a lot of positions (at least 50 stocks)
    
4. _[_6:42 AM_]_
    
    3) a lot of the edge comes from illiquid stuff so you need really good execution
    
5. _[_6:42 AM_]_
    
    it is a very, very tough way to make 25%
