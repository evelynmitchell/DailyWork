```
<article> [Paste your article here] </article> I want you to fact check this article in full. Leave no stone unturned. To do so, first, look at the text of the article and parse out each individual fact — after this, you should have a list of facts. Then, for each fact, do comprehensive research to determine whether it is true, false, or unclear. Aim for at least three independent, high quality and trustworthy sources for each fact. Then, once you've done this for *every* fact, return a table with each fact and its corresponding results (including sources for each check). ```
