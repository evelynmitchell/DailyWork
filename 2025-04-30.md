https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20966 Softpick: No Attention Sink, No Massive Activations with Rectified Softmax "We introduce softpick, a rectified, not sum-to-one, drop-in replacement for softmax in transformer attention mechanisms that eliminates attention sink and massive activations. Our experiments with 340M parameter models demonstrate that softpick maintains performance parity with softmax on standard benchmarks while achieving 0% sink rate. The softpick transformer produces hidden states with significantly lower kurtosis (340 vs 33,510) and creates sparse attention maps (46.97% sparsity). Models using softpick consistently outperform softmax when quantized, with particularly pronounced advantages at lower bit precisions. Our analysis and discussion shows how softpick has the potential to open new possibilities for quantization, low-precision training, sparsity optimization, pruning, and interpretability. Our code is available at [this https URL](https://github.com/zaydzuhri/softpick-attention)."

SYNTACTIC AND SEMANTIC CONTROL OF LARGE
LANGUAGE MODELS VIA SEQUENTIAL MONTE CARLO A wide range of LM applications require generating text that conforms to
syntactic or semantic constraints. Imposing such constraints can be naturally
framed as probabilistic conditioning, but exact generation from the resulting
distribution—which can differ substantially from the LM’s base distribution—is
generally intractable. In this work, we develop an architecture for controlled LM
generation based on sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). Our SMC framework allows
us to flexibly incorporate domain- and problem-specific constraints at inference
time, and efficiently reallocate computational resources in light of new information
during the course of generation. By comparing to a number of alternatives and
ablations on four challenging domains—Python code generation for data science,
text-to-SQL, goal inference, and molecule synthesis—we demonstrate that, with
little overhead, our approach allows small open-source language models to outper-
form models over 8× larger, as well as closed-source, fine-tuned ones. In support
of the probabilistic perspective, we show that these performance improvements
are driven by better approximation to the posterior distribution. Our system builds
on the framework of Lew et al. (2023) and integrates with its language model
probabilistic programming language, giving users a simple, programmable way
to apply SMC to a broad variety of controlled generation problems.
