How to learn to be a product manager? Look at products you use and notice problems and write proposed solutions. Hang out in customer support areas and notice problems. Practice critical thinking, creative problem solving, writing. https://x.com/nurijanian/status/1897014210653286577 "Start by joining communities where PMs hang out. But don't ask for jobs. Instead, start documenting solutions to problems they discuss. If you're not in the room to learn from patterns, this is the next best thing" "Create value before asking for value. Pick one product you use daily. Document every problem you notice. Write detailed solutions. Publish them. This becomes your portfolio." "Build a "shadow product team." Find 2-3 other career switchers. Pick a real problem. Work together like a real product team would. Record everything. This is better than any certification."

fractal journaling obsidian https://stephango.com/vault  https://x.com/kepano/status/1896622716905726095 "Fractal journaling and random revisit I use Obsidian’s unique note hotkey to write individual thoughts as they come up throughout the day. This automatically creates a note with the prefix `YYYY-MM-DD HHmm` to which I may append a title that describes the idea. Every few days I review these journal fragments and compile the salient thoughts. I then review these reviews monthly and yearly. Each time I pull out useful things, and draw connections where relevant. Yearly this takes the form of "40 questions to ask yourself every year". The result is a fractal web of my life that I can zoom in and out of at varying degrees of detail. I can trace back where individual thoughts came from, and how they bubbled up into bigger themes. Every few months I set aside time for a “random revisit”. I use the random note hotkey to quickly travel randomly through my vault. I often use the local graph at shallow depth to see related notes. This is helps me revisit old ideas, create missing links, find inspiration in past thoughts, and do a bit of maintenance, like fixing formatting based on my personal style guide. Fractal journaling and randomization are how I tend my garden. Many people have asked me if this could be automated with language models but I do not care to do so. I enjoy this process. Doing this maintenance helps me understand my own patterns. I don’t want to delegate it." https://x.com/kepano/status/1896622716905726095

"claude code is so good we're doing mandatory employee training and onboarding. our AI productivity strategy has been for folks to use whatever works best, and that's been good for now. however, it feels irresponsible to not upskill everyone on the process 1. plan with o1-pro / o3-mini-high / grok thinking / R1 2. start claude code in repo 3. explain plan and give milestones 4. guide claude through each diff, regularly stopping and reorienting it it seems like the next step change after we built program synthesis auto-completion tools" https://x.com/andrew_n_carr/status/1896705642943168714

My new coding workflow as an ex-PM: 1. Have an idea for a feature in mind 2. Write that in the Cursor chat box in a scrappy format 3. Ask Claude-3.7-thinking to plan for the feature, write a complete design docs without a single line of code (continue in next thread...)
1. Review the plan, and point out silly mistakes or incorrect assumptions Claude made 5. Claude apologizes, and revise the plan 6. Keep chatting until the plan is solid 7. Ask Claude to write the code. While that's happening, go make a coffee or watch some Youtube.
2. 8. Open XCode, and ask Claude to fix all the syntax errors until it can run. 9. Run the code, and debug if neeed. 10. Once it's fully working, git commit and git push. 11. Move on to the next idea. This entire process takes about 1 hour, which took weeks with engineering teams.
3. It used to be spending days writing a PRD, spend hours in meetings, and wait for days to test the first version. Cursor + Claude just made that happen in hours.

People were curious, so here's how I'm using Deep Research. I'll walk through the prompting and then an example: 1. First, I used O1 Pro to build me a prompt for Deep Research to do Deep Research on Deep Research prompting. It read all the blogs and literature on best practices and gave me a thorough report. 2. Then I asked for this to be turned into a prompt template for Deep Research. I've added it below. This routinely creates 3-5 page prompts that are generating 60-100 page, very thorough reports 3. Now when I use O1 Pro to write prompts, I'll write all my thoughts out and ask it to turn it into a prompt using the best practices below: ______ Please build a prompt using the following guidelines: Define the Objective: - Clearly state the main research question or task. - Specify the desired outcome (e.g., detailed analysis, comparison, recommendations). Gather Context and Background: - Include all relevant background information, definitions, and data. - Specify any boundaries (e.g., scope, timeframes, geographic limits). Use Specific and Clear Language: - Provide precise wording and define key terms. - Avoid vague or ambiguous language. Provide Step-by-Step Guidance: - Break the task into sequential steps or sub-tasks. - Organize instructions using bullet points or numbered lists. Specify the Desired Output Format: - Describe how the final answer should be organized (e.g., report format, headings, bullet points, citations). Include any specific formatting requirements. Balance Detail with Flexibility: - Offer sufficient detail to guide the response while allowing room for creative elaboration. - Avoid over-constraining the prompt to enable exploration of relevant nuances. Incorporate Iterative Refinement: - Build in a process to test the prompt and refine it based on initial outputs. - Allow for follow-up instructions to adjust or expand the response as needed. Apply Proven Techniques: - Use methods such as chain-of-thought prompting (e.g., “think step by step”) for complex tasks. - Encourage the AI to break down problems into intermediate reasoning steps. Set a Role or Perspective: - Assign a specific role (e.g., “act as a market analyst” or “assume the perspective of a historian”) to tailor the tone and depth of the analysis. Avoid Overloading the Prompt: - Focus on one primary objective or break multiple questions into separate parts. - Prevent overwhelming the prompt with too many distinct questions. Request Justification and References: - Instruct the AI to support its claims with evidence or to reference sources where possible. - Enhance the credibility and verifiability of the response. Review and Edit Thoroughly: - Ensure the final prompt is clear, logically organized, and complete. - Remove any ambiguous or redundant instructions.
