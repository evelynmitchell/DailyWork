https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming **Semidefinite programming** (**SDP**) is a subfield of [mathematical programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_programming "Mathematical programming") concerned with the optimization of a linear [objective function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective_function "Objective function") (a user-specified function that the user wants to minimize or maximize) over the intersection of the [cone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cone_\(linear_algebra\) "Cone (linear algebra)") of [positive semidefinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Positive-definite_matrix#Negative-definite,_semidefinite_and_indefinite_matrices "Positive-definite matrix") [matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_\(mathematics\) "Matrix (mathematics)") with an [affine space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_space "Affine space"), i.e., a [spectrahedron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectrahedron "Spectrahedron").[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semidefinite_programming#cite_note-:0-1)

https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17836 Clearing Sections of Lattice Liability Networks
Robert Ghrist, Julian Gould, Miguel Lopez, Hans Riess

    Modern financial networks involve complex obligations that transcend simple monetary debts: multiple currencies, prioritized claims, supply chain dependencies, and more. We present a mathematical framework that unifies and extends these scenarios by recasting the classical Eisenberg-Noe model of financial clearing in terms of lattice liability networks. Each node in the network carries a complete lattice of possible states, while edges encode nominal liabilities. Our framework generalizes the scalar-valued clearing vectors of the classical model to lattice-valued clearing sections, preserving the elegant fixed-point structure while dramatically expanding its descriptive power. Our main theorem establishes that such networks possess clearing sections that themselves form a complete lattice under the product order. This structure theorem enables tractable analysis of equilibria in diverse domains, including multi-currency financial systems, decentralized finance with automated market makers, supply chains with resource transformation, and permission networks with complex authorization structures. We further extend our framework to chain-complete lattices for term structure models and multivalued mappings for complex negotiation systems. Our results demonstrate how lattice theory provides a natural language for understanding complex network dynamics across multiple domains, creating a unified mathematical foundation for analyzing systemic risk, resource allocation, and network stability.
