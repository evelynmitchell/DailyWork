Bayesian Optimization w Pytorch https://botorch.org/docs/introduction/ works with https://ax.dev/ a platform for sequential experimentation https://botorch.org/docs/botorch_and_ax/
Ax is an accessible, general-purpose platform for understanding, managing, deploying, and automating adaptive experiments.

Adaptive experimentation is the machine-learning guided process of iteratively exploring a (possibly infinite) parameter space in order to identify optimal configurations in a resource-efficient manner. Ax currently supports Bayesian optimization and bandit optimization as exploration strategies. Bayesian optimization in Ax is powered by [BoTorch](https://github.com/facebookexternal/botorch), a modern library for Bayesian optimization research built on PyTorch.
