https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06329 Expect the Unexpected: FailSafe Long Context QA for Finance
long-context financial benchmark, FailSafeQA,
*Query Failure* scenario, we perturb the original query to vary in domain expertise, completeness, and linguistic accuracy. In the *Context Failure* case, we simulate the uploads of degraded, irrelevant, and empty documents. We employ the LLM-as-a-Judge methodology with Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct and use fine-grained rating criteria to define and calculate Robustness, Context Grounding, and Compliance scores for 24 off-the-shelf models.
