Daily Workflow:
1. Start of Day:

   - Review and transfer relevant todos from previous day
   - Update index.md with the new note
   - Review pending unfiled notes (root yyyy-mm-dd.md files)

2. Throughout Day:
   - Document todos, accomplishments, and notes
   - Use prompts from Prompts/ for consistent documentation
   - Add screenshots/attachments to img/ with descriptive names
   - Link related notes using Obsidian wiki-links [[note-name]]

3. End of Day:
   - Review and update todo status
   - Move any unfiled notes to DailyNotes/
   - Commit changes with message format: "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - Daily Update"
   - Push to GitHub repository

Content Guidelines:
1. Daily Notes Structure:
   - Start with date and day of week
   - Include sections: Todos, Accomplishments, Notes, Ideas
   - Tag important items with #project, #followup, #urgent
   - Link to related notes and resources

2. Organization:
   - Use consistent headers (H1 for title, H2 for main sections)
   - Create links between related notes
   - Add context to todos (priority, deadline, dependencies)
   - Document project ideas with initial scope and goals

3. Version Control:
   - Commit at least daily
   - Use meaningful commit messages
   - Keep sensitive information in separate, non-committed files
   - Regular backups to remote repository

4. Maintenance:
   - Weekly review of unfiled notes
   - Monthly cleanup of obsolete todos
   - Regular validation of index.md completeness
   - Archive completed projects to dedicated sections
