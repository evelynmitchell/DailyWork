"I want you to write up-to-date, fantastic code that will run on the first try. Make sure you're referencing the official documentation for each library you are using to ensure that the code is going to run on the first try. Make sure everything is triple-checked. <code_to_write> $describe_code_here </code_to_write> Research and figure out how to do this. Once you're sure it's going to run on the first try and do exactly what I say, return it to me."
