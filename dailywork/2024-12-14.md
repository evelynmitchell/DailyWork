The Feedback River (via

) Create a central channel (Slack works great) where ALL feedback flows: • Customer emails • Support tickets • Sales calls • User research • Analytics alerts • Social media mentions Every piece of feedback gets posted here. No exceptions.
...
The Context Protocol Every feedback item must include: • Original verbatim feedback • Customer segment/size • Feature/product area • Current workaround • Business impact This seems like overkill until you're in a prioritization meeting defending against the "but Customer X really needs this!"

The Memory Bank Create a simple database (even a spreadsheet works) tracking: • Total mentions of each problem • Frequency over time • Revenue impact • Strategic alignment • Technical complexity Now you have data to balance against the latest urgent request.

When reviewing your products and roadmap, ask: - What are the key feedback loops? - Where are the delays in the system? - What are the hidden incentives? - Which metrics reinforce current behavior? - What mental models drive decisions?

# API testing


Issue: current api testing is a spin up, connect, delete (a smoke test), not a more typical usage test.



-----------------------

Issue: there are no tests of Auth Token usage patterns

Issue: there are no billing tests (customer Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD); auth token CRUD, usage count, supabase usage db CRUD, reporting of usage CRUD; auth scopes around reporting)

Issue: once usage reporting is started, some interface to payment system is needed out of supabase)
