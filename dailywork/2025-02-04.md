https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17161 SFT Memorizes, RL Generalizes: A Comparative Study of Foundation Model Post-training ; https://tianzhechu.com/SFTvsRL/  "We show that RL, especially when trained with an outcome-based reward, generalizes across both **_textual rule_ variations** and **_visual_ variations**. SFT, in contrast, tends to memorize training data and struggles to generalize to unseen rules or out-of-distribution scenarios." https://github.com/LeslieTrue/SFTvsRL
