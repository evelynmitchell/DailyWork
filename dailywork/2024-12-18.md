# standup
[ ] git fix kye 6.7.2 -> 5.5.7 is too big
   pyproject.toml needs to match requirements.txt
[ ] standup
	[ ] dns status - supposedly working DNS_PROBE_FINISHED_NXDOMAIN on api.swarms.ai
	[ ] automated swagger docs
	[ ] uv install now under 8 seconds - still cleanup to do
	[x] Patrick demoing converting swarms python to rust rustify

		[ ] swarms generator = help companies come up with ideas for swarms
		[ ] swe-agent a devin clone
		[ ] Mike https://wasmer.io/posts/py2wasm-a-python-to-wasm-compiler
		[ ] errors
			[ ] gradio won't offer a feature to send a prompt on enter
			[ ] rustify - truncate due to api limit
			[ ] swarm generator not precise responses yet, because it's not grounded with the swarms code
			[ ] all code is actually running
			[ ] using separate python venv using groq api for testing
			[ ] agent rearrange - for sequential swarms, the models were the issue, not the swarms code

	[ ] linting
	[ ] redo pytest ; remove failing tests; ask model for test coverage review
	[ ] start gathering examples for llm-as-a-judge out of the readme examples and the swams prompts
	[/ ] Mike setup SES and cognito swarms.ai
	[ x] kye - unit testing is up without pytest
	[ ] kye - agent api docs are out of date
		[ ] workflow to update docs when the code changes
	[ ] harshell documentation agent
	[ ] kye openai assistants working now
	[ ] kye agentic evals - evalOps
	[ ] kye agents to make the prompts better if the eval is bad
