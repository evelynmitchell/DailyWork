# Notes
In a random forest decision making process, when you make a choice, record the path which led you to that choice. Include the factors which led to the choice. If you never use a factor to make a decision, you do not need to calculate it.

Pick a simple model. Use it to make decisions. As you test it against the world (current context, model output for inputs, decision, decision justification), you will refine your model through learning.
