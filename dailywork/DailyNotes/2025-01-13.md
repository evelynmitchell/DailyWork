This is a very good paper with a simple setup, which demonstrated a way to fine tune a generation set of small models and a critic set of small models to be good at a diverse set of tasks. The models were small and old, and the tasks also small and old. Excited to try this on harder problems and with newer open source small models. Excited to do an LLM-as-a-judge pass on the critics, and an rStar pass on the data generation. 
The summary stage, majority voting, and positive/negative pair weighting all helpful.
The debate didn't require more than a majority vote, so tree-of-thoughts or graph-of-thoughts or rStar may all improve this significantly.
Could also use multiple LLMs to increase diversity of skills learned, with a size/accuracy RL reward over distinct skills
One thing I would add would be categorizing the inputs by similarity, and check whether diversity of inputs helps or hinders diversity of fine tuning of generative/critic models

OP 5 Time Series Forecasting Libraries in 2025  
  
(with Pros and GitHub Stars)  
  
🟢 𝗡𝗶𝘅𝘁𝗹𝗮 𝗦𝗲𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗟𝗶𝗯𝗿𝗮𝗿𝗶𝗲𝘀 - 𝟭𝟮𝗸 ⭐  
Nixtla is a set of state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods that are embedded in a set of libraries and models, most famous are:  
-> statsforecast  
-> neuralforecast  
-> TimeGPT  
  
Today, Nixtla is a go-to environment to solve time series forecasting problems.  
  
🟢 𝗗𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗦 - 𝟴𝗸 ⭐  
Darts offers a consistent 𝘧𝘪𝘵() and 𝘱𝘳𝘦𝘥𝘪𝘤𝘵() interface across various forecasting models, from classical methods like ARIMA to deep learning models.  
  
This makes it easy to compare and switch between different models without needing to understand their internal workings  
  
🟢 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝗽𝗵𝗲𝘁 - 𝟭𝟴.𝟰𝗸 ⭐  
Prophet is specifically designed for users with limited statistical knowledge, allowing them to easily handle seasonal effects and missing data.  
  
Its intuitive interface makes it accessible for business applications requiring quick and interpretable forecasts.  
  
🟢 𝗦𝗞𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 - 𝟳.𝟴𝗸 ⭐  
SKtime provides a scikit-learn-compatible framework for time series analysis, enabling users to apply machine learning techniques seamlessly.  
  
This integration allows for easy model tuning, validation, and deployment using familiar tools.  
  
You can also easily use embedded scikit-learn data transformers for feature generation  
  
🟢 𝗚𝗹𝘂𝗼𝗻-𝗧𝗦 - 𝟰.𝟲𝗸 ⭐  
GluonTS is focused on probabilistic forecasting, allowing users to generate not just point forecasts but also confidence intervals.  
  
It can also be easily integrated with Amazon SageMaker, allowing users to scale their training and deployment processes efficiently.

# agent ideas

Templates to create model scaffolding: data gen, training, inference, paper writing, docs.
# daily work review

```
I'll analyze your daily activities and suggest potential business opportunities, focusing on what you're already doing. Looking at your work, I see several themes that could be developed into business opportunities:

1. AI/ML Development & Research Focus
Based on your activities around modern-GAN, agent systems, and paper reviews, you seem to have deep expertise in AI systems. Potential business directions:

- AI Model Template Business
  - Turn your scaffolding templates idea (data gen, training, inference, paper writing, docs) into a productized service
  - Metrics to track: Template downloads, time saved per project, customer satisfaction
  - Key activities: Template development, documentation, support

2. Research Analysis & Synthesis
Your paper group activity and detailed analysis shows strong research synthesis abilities:

- AI Research Consulting Service
  - Offer research summaries and implementation guidance for companies
  - Metrics: Client projects, implementation success rate, research coverage
  - Track: Hours spent reading/analyzing, client outcomes

3. Technical Infrastructure
Your work on server setup and workflows suggests infrastructure expertise:

- MLOps Automation Service
  - Package your workflow knowledge (gumloop/kestra) into reproducible solutions
  - Metrics: Deployment time reduction, system reliability, customer base
  - Track: Setup time, maintenance needs, automation coverage

Let me suggest a directed graph of activities you should be doing:

Additional metrics you should track:

1. Research & Development
- Papers reviewed per week
- Implementation attempts/successes
- Time from paper to working code

2. Template Development
- Template completion rate
- User adoption rate
- Time saved per template
- Customer feedback scores

3. Infrastructure
- Server uptime
- Automation success rate
- Deployment time
- Resource utilization

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or suggest specific next steps for one of these business directions?
