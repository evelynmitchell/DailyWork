Chatted with Brian about HIPPA

Wrote new prompt I like. [[MintoWriting]] It is a back and forth conversation where I start with a paragraph about a situation, and the LLM prompts me about the Complication (what has changed), Question (what needs to be asked arising out of the Situation+Complication), and finally, Answer. 

More playing with OpenHands. I need a better UI for tracking prompts with it. I'll look at Backstage by Spotify, or a DAG tool (Airflow, dask, ray)
