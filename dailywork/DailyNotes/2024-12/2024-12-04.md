# Paper Group
Reviewed HF daily papers, nothing that exciting. But this is an interesting agent paper: [[https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01250]] It uses a style of questioning to enable a vlm to help ground an investigation in the world to collaborate with a human.

This physics dataset looks awesome: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.00568 https://polymathic-ai.org/the_well/datasets_overview/
