# Building Distribution package

The swarms build uses python 3.9, and poetry

```yaml
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install poetry
        run: pipx install poetry==$POETRY_VERSION
      - name: Set up Python 3.9
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: "3.9"
          cache: "poetry"
      - name: Build project for distribution
        run: poetry build
```
