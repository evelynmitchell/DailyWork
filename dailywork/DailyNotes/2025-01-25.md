https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pallas/quickstart.html Pallas is an extension to JAX that enables writing custom kernels for GPU and TPU. Pallas allows you to use the same JAX functions and APIs but operates at a _lower_ level of abstraction. Specifically, Pallas requires users to think about memory access and how to divide up computations across multiple compute units in a hardware accelerator. On GPUs, Pallas lowers to Triton and on TPUs, Pallas lowers to Mosaic.
