try Kestra: https://kestra.io Complicated, but looks to be a good workflow orchestration system for agents

Thinking of giving up on DO for app hosting sophie, and trying elsewhere

try out gumloop - the onboarding is good, because it is deliberately difficult, so you try out the chat help

# uv and poetry

# rig LLM use in Rust, agents

```rust
use rig::{completion::Prompt, providers::openai};

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() {
    // Create OpenAI client and agent.
    // This requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable to be set.
    let openai_client = openai::Client::from_env();

    let gpt4 = openai_client.agent("gpt-4").build();

    // Prompt the model and print its response
    let response = gpt4
        .prompt("Who are you?")
        .await
        .expect("Failed to prompt GPT-4");

    println!("GPT-4: {response}");
}
