https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction MCP is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs. Think of MCP like a USB-C port for AI applications. Just as USB-C provides a standardized way to connect your devices to various peripherals and accessories, MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models to different data sources and tools.

https://inference.net/ [inference.net](https://inference.net/) is a wholesaler of LLM inference tokens for models like [Llama 3.1](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B). We provide real-time and batch inference APIs at a 50-90% discount from what you would pay [together.ai](https://www.together.ai/pricing) or [groq](https://www.groq.com/pricing). If you're spending > $10K/month on inference, we can likely reduce your costs substantially.
