"I need help organizing and processing a Product Requirements Document (PRD) into appropriate downstream documents and tracking systems. Please analyze the PRD and categorize its contents into the following components:

1. Requirements (with suggested categorization and IDs):
    - Business/Product Requirements (BR-xxx)
    - User Requirements (UR-xxx)
    - Functional Requirements (FR-xxx)
    - Technical Requirements (TR-xxx)
    - Security Requirements (SR-xxx)
    - Deployment Requirements (DR-xxx)
    - Performance Requirements (PR-xxx)
2. Implementation Artifacts:
    - Code snippets/examples (to be version controlled)
    - Technical specifications
    - API definitions
    - Database schemas
3. Operational Documentation:
    - Deployment runbook structure and content
    - Security documentation and compliance requirements
    - Monitoring and alerting setup
    - Incident response procedures
    - Backup and recovery procedures
4. Task Tracking:
    - GitHub Issues template for different types of tasks
    - Integration with requirement IDs
    - Acceptance criteria format
    - Definition of Done criteria
    - Priority and severity classifications

Please help me:

1. Create a requirements traceability matrix showing relationships between different requirement types
2. Generate a deployment runbook template with standard sections and checklist items
3. Develop a comprehensive security documentation template aligned with common security frameworks (e.g., OWASP, NIST)
4. Set up GitHub Issues templates for:
    - Feature development tasks
    - Bug reports
    - Security issues
    - Documentation tasks
    - Deployment tasks

For each deliverable, please include:

- Standard format and structure
- Required fields and metadata
- Cross-referencing methodology
- Review and approval process
- Version control approach
- Update and maintenance procedures"
