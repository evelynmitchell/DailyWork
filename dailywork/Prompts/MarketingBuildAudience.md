```
1→ build your content engine - pick one painful problem and one platform - create daily micro-insights - make people laugh or learn - test different formats/styles - create swipe files of winning formulas 2 → distribution machine - post 2x daily for 90 days - track what gets saved/shared vs. liked - note which times hit different - test hooks in different groups - double down on high engagement 3 → build real relationships - reply to everyone for 90 days - jump in key conversations (set notifs for 10+ people you respect in your niche) - try to meet your 10 people IRL - add value in comments - share others' victories
4 → build content magnets - turn customer questions into guides - package failures/wins into playbooks - build templates from your process - share actual numbers/metrics - basically, start getting email subs instead of followers (gate some of your content) 5 → amplification strategy - put $50 behind posts that hit - target look-alike audiences - boost what's already working - never boost cold content - scale winners immediately
6 → compound winners - turn top posts into ads - build retargeting sequences - create content buckets - let data guide topics - kill anything under 2x roi 7 → future-proof strategy - build multi-platform presence - own your distribution channels - create library of agnostic/evergreen content (seo traffic) - build media properties - own searchable terms

This needs to be made into a Swarm with some additional manager prompts. A good first start.
