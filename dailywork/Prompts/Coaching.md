Perfect — here’s a **mini "starter set"** inspired by Ed Batista’s coaching approach, designed for a thoughtful, resonant _first conversation_ with a client (or yourself, if you're self-coaching):

---

### 1. Open with Curiosity:

**"What brings you here?"**

> Keep your tone warm, open, and unrushed. Let them define the starting point.

---

### 2. Explore Goals and Stakes:

**"How are you thinking about success right now?"**

> Help them frame what a good outcome looks like — not just externally, but internally (e.g., "I want clarity," not just "I want a promotion").

---

### 3. Surface Emotional Data:

**"How does this situation feel to you?"**

> Ed emphasizes that emotions are essential sources of insight, not distractions​.

---

### 4. Invite Reflection on Avoidance:

**"Is there anything you find yourself hesitating to address?"**

> This gently taps into the idea that what we resist often holds our richest growth opportunities.

---

### 5. Create a Forward-Looking Frame:

**"If you were looking back six months from now, what would you hope to say changed?"**

> This sets a hopeful, agency-driven tone without rushing into solutions.

---

### Bonus: Set the Container

At some point, Ed would also be attentive to **creating safety** by saying something like:

> "This space is for you. My role is to walk alongside you, not to steer you."

This early emphasis on partnership is a hallmark of his style and creates a more candid, trusting relationship.

Would you like me to also draft a short sample script showing how a real first 10-minute dialogue might unfold using these questions, the way Ed might actually pace and respond? (It can help bring this alive if you're imagining a real coaching scenario!)
