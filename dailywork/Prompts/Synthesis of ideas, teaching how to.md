Do you know the paper Types of synthesis and their criteria by Strike and Posner (1983)?

Can you give me examples of "Creating a superordinate theory"?

  
If you were to describe the pattern of thought which led to those examples, as a mentor would guide a student, what would you say?

  
What rubric would you use, as a mentor, to evaluate the efforts of a student trying to learn that?
