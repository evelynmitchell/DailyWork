Below is a textual Kanban board that spans all the key departments. Each “swimlane” represents an organizational function (or department). Within each lane, the “cards” represent core roles and recurring tasks—with each card listing its tasks/responsibilities and the key metrics used to evaluate performance. For roles or functions that can be outsourced, the card is marked with “(outsourced)” and the metric ownership is shifted to a Vendor Management Agent.

You can implement this board in any Kanban tool (like Jira, Trello, or Asana) by creating swimlanes for each department and adding cards for each task. You may also consider using integrated dashboards (with Tableau, PowerBI, or Looker) to automatically pull in the metric data.

### **Tools & Implementation Suggestions**

- **Kanban & Project Management:**
    
    - **Trello, Jira, or Asana:** Set up swimlanes for each department and create cards as detailed above.
    - **Custom Workflows:** Configure columns (e.g., “Planned,” “In Progress,” “Review,” “Done”) to track recurring tasks and initiatives for each card.
- **Metrics & Dashboard Integration:**
    
    - **Tableau, PowerBI, or Looker:** Integrate these with your operational data to pull in real-time metrics for each card (e.g., SLA adherence, revenue impact, cost savings).
    - **Custom APIs/Integrations:** Automate data flows from financial systems, CRM, and monitoring tools to update your Kanban dashboard automatically.
- **Documentation & Collaboration:**
    
    - **Confluence or Notion:** Link detailed process documentation and agent instructions directly to the Kanban cards for easy reference.
    - **Slack/MS Teams:** Use channel integrations to receive alerts on key metric thresholds (e.g., if a KPI slips below target).
- **Vendor Management:**
    
    - When a role/function is marked as **(outsourced)**, assign metric oversight to a dedicated Vendor Management Agent. Track vendor performance through a separate Kanban lane or dedicated cards integrated with your procurement system.
