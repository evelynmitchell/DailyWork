Project Requirements Document to trackable lists of requirments, tasks, runbooks.

```
There are several types of sentences in the design doc. I see: programming language code, context statements, project requirements, implementation requirements, user requirements, deployment requirements, tasks, security requirements. I may have missed some. The way I use each of these statements varies. Programming language code is checked into the repository, executed, and tested. Requirements are assigned an id and tracked in an requirements tracking system. Tasks go into a task tracking system. Deployments are described in more detail in a runbook.

Can you create a proper requirements document with traceability? * Develop the deployment runbook? * Create a security documentation template? * Set up a GitHub Issues template for task tracking?
