https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948 DeepSeek-R1: Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning  ", a model trained via large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) without supervised fine-tuning (SFT) as a preliminary step" SFT uses human annotated positive and negative examples, so this training workflow can have many more topic areas, using examples generated by other LLMs. 
"DeepSeek-R1, which incorporates multi-stage training and cold-start data before RL. "
What is multi-stage traning?
What is cold-start data?
What RL technique? "GRPO" https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03300 DeepSeekMath: Pushing the Limits of Mathematical Reasoning in Open Language Models "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a variant reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) (Schulman et al., 2017).
GRPO foregoes the critic model, instead estimating the baseline from group scores, significantly
reducing training resources." https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-math https://github.com/replicate/cog/blob/main/docs/python.md
