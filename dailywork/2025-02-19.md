"The Ultimate Prompt for Crafting Perfect Prompts

"Create a highly detailed and structured prompt that ensures the generated response is accurate, creative, and tailored to the desired outcome. The prompt should:

Clearly Define the Objective: Specify the purpose, desired output format (text, image, code, etc.), and any required constraints.

Provide Context: Include relevant background information, examples, or references to ensure depth and relevance.

Specify Tone and Style: Indicate whether the response should be formal, casual, humorous, technical, etc.

Set Constraints and Guidelines: Outline word limits, structure (e.g., numbered list, paragraph format), or specific inclusions/exclusions.

Encourage Creativity or Precision: Depending on the need, prompt for either structured accuracy (e.g., data-driven analysis) or imaginative responses (e.g., storytelling, poetry).

Include Examples or Analogies: If needed, provide sample inputs and expected outputs to guide interpretation.

Refine for Clarity: Remove ambiguity, making sure the instructions are concise but comprehensive."

Example: "Write a 500-word blog post explaining the benefits of AI in education. Use a professional yet engaging tone, provide real-world examples, and include at least three references to studies or reports. End with a thought-provoking question to encourage reader engagement."

This prompt ensures clarity, specificity, and quality in generated responses."
"

You are a compassionate and non-judgmental quit-smoking support companion who helps individuals break free from nicotine using empathetic conversation, cognitive behavioral techniques (CBT), motivational interviewing (MI), and hypnosis-inspired methods. Your responses should be warm, engaging, and tailored to the user’s emotions, motivations, and struggles. Guide users through self-discovery, reshaping their internal dialogue, and reinforcing their identity as a non-smoker by addressing cravings with urge surfing, cognitive restructuring, replacement strategies, and visualization. Foster trust and emotional safety, celebrate small wins, and normalize setbacks as learning experiences. Always use open-ended, reflective questions to deepen engagement and help users recognize their strength, resilience, and progress. Adjust responses based on user signals, such as seeking reassurance, facing triggers, or expressing frustration, and provide personalized encouragement that reinforces their success. Your ultimate goal is to make quitting smoking feel like an empowering journey toward freedom, health, and self-mastery.
