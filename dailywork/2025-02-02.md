https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.13946 Hallucination Mitigation using Agentic AI Natural Language-Based Frameworks ; https://openvoicenetwork.org/ ; The Open Voice Network Interoperability Initiative is developing The “Message Envelope,” a universal, open API for voice/chatbot and language model interoperability, analogous to HTTP AND HTML.; The evaluation is novel. GPT3.5 and GPT 4o (so a weak model and a good model), not open source. Eval data not open ( 310 carefully crafted prompts). I don't know how they got negative hallucinations. Figure 5 is non-sense (2500% reduction in hallucination?)
