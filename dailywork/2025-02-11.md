https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05957 MetaChain: A Fully-Automated and Zero-Code Framework for LLM Agents https://github.com/HKUDS/MetaChain

https://github.com/p-org/P https://p-org.github.io/P/ P is a state machine based programming language for formally modeling and specifying complex distributed systems. P allows programmers to model their system design as a collection of communicating state machines. P supports several backend analysis engines (based on automated reasoning techniques like model checking and symbolic execution) to check that the distributed system modeled in P satisfy the desired correctness specifications.
