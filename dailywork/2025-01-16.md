https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08828 MMDocIR: Benchmarking Multi-Modal Retrieval for Long Documents ; evals ; small but heavily annotated document dataset with lots of figures and images.
'To this
end, we identify four specific types of questions that **do not** align
well with the objectives of IR ' 
• Summarization Questions: These questions, such as “What does
this book mainly illustrate?” require a comprehensive understanding of large sections of a document or even the entire document.
The broad scope makes it hard to pinpoint specific content effectively, which contradicts the precise nature of IR tasks.
• Overwhelm Statistical Questions: Questions that demand extensive data computation or collation, such as “How many words
are there in total in the paper?” also fall outside our scope. These
require a level of statistical analysis that goes beyond retrieval.
• Online Search Questions: For example, queries like “What is the
Google Scholar citation count of the main author of this article?”
rely on information from external online resources. Since our
focus is on retrieving information that is internally available
within the documents, these questions are excluded.
• Unanswerable Questions: These are designed to test if models
generate answers based on non-existent information (model hallucinations). Since they do not facilitate the retrieval of factual
document-based information, these questions are excluded.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09019 Ouroboros-Diffusion: Exploring Consistent Content Generation in Tuning-free Long Video Diffusion 
a novel video denoising framework designed to enhance structural and content (subject) consistency, enabling the generation of consistent videos of arbitrary length. Specifically, we introduce a
new latent sampling technique at the queue tail to improve
structural consistency, ensuring perceptually smooth transitions among frames. To enhance subject consistency, we devise a Subject-Aware Cross-Frame Attention (SACFA) mechanism, which aligns subjects across frames within short segments to achieve better visual coherence. Furthermore, we
introduce self-recurrent guidance. This technique leverages
information from all previous cleaner frames at the front of
the queue to guide the denoising of noisier frames at the
end, fostering rich and contextual global information interaction

pecifically, instead of
initializing the tail latent with Gaussian noise, OuroborosDiffusion extracts the low-frequency component from the
second-to-last frame latent using Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) and combines it with the high-frequency part of random noise to create the enqueued latent

The low-frequency
component preserves layout information for overall video
consistency, while the high-frequency component introduces
necessary video dynamics.

t. Specifically, Ouroboros-Diffusion utilizes the long-term memory derived from the frame at the
head of the queue to guide the denoising of noisier frames
near the tail, optimizing the latent through a subject-aware
gradient during video denoising.
