https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16834 Discrete Diffusion Modeling by Estimating the Ratios of the Data Distribution "Despite their groundbreaking performance for many generative modeling tasks, diffusion models have fallen short on discrete data domains such as natural language. Crucially, standard diffusion models rely on the well-established theory of score matching, but efforts to generalize this to discrete structures have not yielded the same empirical gains. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing score entropy, a novel loss that naturally extends score matching to discrete spaces, integrates seamlessly to build discrete diffusion models, and significantly boosts performance. Experimentally, we test our Score Entropy Discrete Diffusion models (SEDD) on standard language modeling tasks. For comparable model sizes, SEDD beats existing language diffusion paradigms (reducing perplexity by 25-75\%) and is competitive with autoregressive models, in particular outperforming GPT-2. Furthermore, compared to autoregressive mdoels, SEDD generates faithful text without requiring distribution annealing techniques like temperature scaling (around 6-8× better generative perplexity than un-annealed GPT-2), can trade compute and quality (similar quality with 32× fewer network evaluations), and enables controllable infilling (matching nucleus sampling quality while enabling other strategies besides left to right prompting)." https://github.com/louaaron/score-entropy-discrete-diffusion

https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05232 Universal Neural Functionals "A challenging problem in many modern machine learning tasks is to process weight-space features, i.e., to transform or extract information from the weights and gradients of a neural network. Recent works have developed promising weight-space models that are equivariant to the permutation symmetries of simple feedforward networks. However, they are not applicable to general architectures, since the permutation symmetries of a weight space can be complicated by recurrence or residual connections. This work proposes an algorithm that automatically constructs permutation equivariant models, which we refer to as universal neural functionals (UNFs), for any weight space. Among other applications, we demonstrate how UNFs can be substituted into existing learned optimizer designs, and find promising improvements over prior methods when optimizing small image classifiers and language models. Our results suggest that learned optimizers can benefit from considering the (symmetry) structure of the weight space they optimize. We open-source our library for constructing UNFs at." https://github.com/AllanYangZhou/universal_neural_functional https://github.com/AllanYangZhou/nfn

https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02670 Affordable AI Assistants with Knowledge Graph of Thoughts "Large Language Models (LLMs) are revolutionizing the development of AI assistants capable of performing diverse tasks across domains. However, current state-of-the-art LLM-driven agents face significant challenges, including high operational costs and limited success rates on complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address these issues, we propose the Knowledge Graph of Thoughts (KGoT), an innovative AI assistant architecture that integrates LLM reasoning with dynamically constructed knowledge graphs (KGs). KGoT extracts and structures task-relevant knowledge into a dynamic KG representation, iteratively enhanced through external tools such as math solvers, web crawlers, and Python scripts. Such structured representation of task-relevant knowledge enables low-cost models to solve complex tasks effectively. For example, KGoT achieves a 29% improvement in task success rates on the GAIA benchmark compared to Hugging Face Agents with GPT-4o mini, while reducing costs by over 36x compared to GPT-4o. Improvements for recent reasoning models are similar, e.g., 36% and 37.5% for Qwen2.5-32B and Deepseek-R1-70B, respectively. KGoT offers a scalable, affordable, and high-performing solution for AI assistants."![[Screenshot from 2025-04-18 20-19-18.png]]
