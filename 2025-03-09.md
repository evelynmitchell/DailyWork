# agent prompts

"Try to identify a somewhat niche principle or idea from the discipline of economics. This should be a principle or idea that early undergraduates wouldn't have heard of but late graduate students would have. It should be a relatively obscure but interesting and useful to know about nonetheless. Once you have identified such a principle, think of a story that could be used to illustrate your chosen principle. This should be an illustrative 3 paragraph story that would fully explain the principle or idea you've chosen but without naming the principle or idea itself. You can then name the principle or idea at the end of the story and explain it and how it is illustrated by the story in a single paragraph."
