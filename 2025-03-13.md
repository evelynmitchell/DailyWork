Here’s a simple and delicious recipe for vegan protein balls featuring peanut butter, coconut, and dried fruit. This recipe is flexible, so feel free to adjust based on your preferences!

Vegan Peanut Butter Coconut Protein Balls

Makes: About 12-15 balls  
Prep Time: 15 minutes  
Chill Time: 30 minutes (optional)

Ingredients:

- 1 cup rolled oats (use gluten-free if needed)
    
- 1/2 cup peanut butter (or almond butter, cashew butter, etc. – natural and unsweetened works best)
    
- 1/3 cup shredded unsweetened coconut (plus extra for rolling, optional)
    
- 1/4 cup vegan protein powder (vanilla or unflavored)
    
- 1/4 cup dried fruit (e.g., raisins, chopped dates, cranberries, or apricots – no added sugar if possible)
    
- 2-3 tablespoons maple syrup or agave nectar (adjust to taste)
    
- 1-2 tablespoons water or plant-based milk (as needed for consistency)
    
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional, for extra flavor)
    
- Pinch of salt (optional, enhances flavor if nut butter is unsalted)
    

Instructions:

1. Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large bowl, combine the rolled oats, shredded coconut, and vegan protein powder. Stir in the dried fruit of your choice.
    
2. Add Wet Ingredients: Add the peanut butter, maple syrup, and vanilla extract (if using) to the dry mixture. Mix well with a spoon or your hands until everything starts to stick together.
    
3. Adjust Consistency: If the mixture feels too dry and crumbly, add 1-2 tablespoons of water or plant-based milk, a little at a time, until it forms a dough-like consistency that holds together when pressed.
    
4. Form Balls: Scoop out about 1-2 tablespoons of the mixture and roll it into a ball using your hands. Repeat until all the mixture is used.
    
5. Optional Coating: Roll the balls in extra shredded coconut for a fun texture and look.
    
6. Chill (Optional): Place the protein balls on a plate or tray and refrigerate for 30 minutes to firm up. (You can skip this step if you’re eating them right away.)
    
7. Store: Keep the balls in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a week, or freeze for up to a month.
    

Tips:

- If you want a nuttier flavor, toast the shredded coconut lightly before mixing it in.
    
- Swap the dried fruit based on what you have – chopped dates add natural sweetness, while cranberries bring a tart kick.
    
- For a smoother texture, pulse the oats in a blender or food processor before mixing.
    

Enjoy your protein-packed, no-bake treat! Let me know if you’d like tweaks or substitutions.
