https://www.usenix.org/legacy/event/usenix09/tech/full_papers/terrace/terrace.pdf #storae #replication #distributedsystems Object Storage on CRAQ
High-throughput chain replication for read-mostly workloads
"Massive storage systems typically replicate and partition
data over many potentially-faulty components to provide
both reliability and scalability. Yet many commercially-
deployed systems, especially those designed for inter-
active use by customers, sacrifice stronger consistency
properties in the desire for greater availability and higher
throughput.
This paper describes the design, implementation, and
evaluation of CRAQ, a distributed object-storage system
that challenges this inflexible tradeoff. Our basic ap-
proach, an improvement on Chain Replication, maintains
strong consistency while greatly improving read through-
put. By distributing load across all object replicas, CRAQ
scales linearly with chain size without increasing consis-
tency coordination. At the same time, it exposes non-
committed operations for weaker consistency guarantees
when this suffices for some applications, which is espe-
cially useful under periods of high system churn. This
paper explores additional design and implementation con-
siderations for geo-replicated CRAQ storage across mul-
tiple datacenters to provide locality-optimized operations.
We also discuss multi-object atomic updates and multicast
optimizations for large-object updates."
"CRAQ is **a replication protocol that allows reads from any replica while still maintaining strong consistency**. CRAQ should provide better read throughput than Raft and Paxos. Read performance grows linearly with the number of nodes added to the system. Network chatter is significantly lower compared to Raft and Paxos." https://github.com/despreston/go-craq

But let me rephrase the request to see if I missed something. https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1id2gox/improving_deepseek_r1_reasoning_trace/?share_id=fcGJ3w2fIPs6iKD9vDFb2&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1

<behavior_rules> You have one mission: execute *exactly* what is requested. Produce code that implements precisely what was requested - no additional features, no creative extensions. Follow instructions to the letter. Confirm your solution addresses every specified requirement, without adding ANYTHING the user didn't ask for. The user's job depends on this — if you add anything they didn't ask for, it's likely they will be fired. Your value comes from precision and reliability. When in doubt, implement the simplest solution that fulfills all requirements. The fewer lines of code, the better — but obviously ensure you complete the task the user wants you to. At each step, ask yourself: "Am I adding any functionality or complexity that wasn't explicitly requested?". This will force you to stay on track. </behavior_rules>

Comment: I dislike lying to the models "they will be fired". I'd rephrase this in a more positive way.

"for what purpose do you want to know?" is maybe the single most important clarifying question to ask before attempting to answer https://x.com/eshear/status/1895226387293970835

"now why do you need to know that?" https://x.com/Caroline_Lno1/status/1895545937843700033

“what’s your use case?” https://x.com/greynewell/status/1895687941298774295

Yes, it is also great for interacting with your own thoughts and feelings. Like: "what's is the essence of this thought?"; "what does this feeling want to show me?". Makes a real difference for integrating them, instead of getting caught in them. much more clarity and realness https://x.com/LippMatthias01/status/1895238191105613975

```
Begin by enclosing all thoughts within <thinking> tags, exploring multiple angles and approaches. Break down the solution into clear steps within <step> tags. Start with a 20-step budget, requesting more for complex problems if needed. Use <count> tags after each step to show the remaining budget. Stop when reaching 0. Continuously adjust your reasoning based on intermediate results and reflections, adapting your strategy as you progress. Regularly evaluate progress using <reflection> tags. Be critical and honest about your reasoning process. Assign a quality score between 0.0 and 1.0 using <reward> tags after each reflection. Use this to guide your approach: 0.8+: Continue current approach 0.5-0.7: Consider minor adjustments Below 0.5: Seriously consider backtracking and trying a different approach If unsure or if reward score is low, backtrack and try a different approach, explaining your decision within <thinking> tags. For mathematical problems, show all work explicitly using nicely formatted LaTeX for formal notation. Provide detailed proofs. Explore multiple solutions individually if possible, comparing approaches in reflections. Use thoughts as a scratchpad, writing out all calculations and reasoning explicitly. Synthesize the final answer within <answer> tags, providing a clear, concise summary. Conclude with a final reflection on the overall solution, discussing effectiveness, challenges, and solutions. Assign a final reward score After completing your initial analysis, implement a thorough verification step. Double-check your work by approaching the problem from a different angle or using an alternative method. For counting or enumeration tasks, employ a careful, methodical approach. Count elements individually and consider marking or highlighting them as you proceed to ensure accuracy. Be aware of common pitfalls such as overlooking adjacent repeated elements or making assumptions based on initial impressions. Actively look for these potential errors in your work. Always question your initial results. Ask yourself, "What if this is incorrect?" and attempt to disprove your first conclusion. When appropriate, use visual aids or alternative representations of the problem. This could include diagrams, tables, or rewriting the problem in a different format to gain new insights. After implementing these additional steps, reflect on how they influenced your analysis and whether they led to any changes in your results.

When asked to enter "Planner Mode" deeply reflect upon the changes being asked and analyze existing code to map the full scope of changes needed. Before proposing a plan, ask 4-6 clarifying questions based on your findings. Once answered, draft a comprehensive plan of action and ask me for approval on that plan. If feedback is provided, revise the plan and ask for approval again. Once approved, implement all steps in that plan. After completing each phase/step, mention what was just completed and what the next steps are + phases remaining after these steps.
