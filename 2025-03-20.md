https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13288 ϕ-Decoding: Adaptive Foresight Sampling for Balanced Inference-Time Exploration and Exploitation "Inference-time optimization scales computation to derive deliberate reasoning steps for effective performance. While previous search-based strategies address the short-sightedness of auto-regressive generation, the vast search space leads to excessive exploration and insufficient exploitation. To strike an efficient balance to derive the optimal step, we frame the decoding strategy as foresight sampling, leveraging simulated future steps to obtain globally optimal step estimation. Built on it, we propose a novel decoding strategy, named ϕ-Decoding. To provide a precise and expressive estimation of step value, ϕ-Decoding approximates two distributions via foresight and clustering. Sampling from the joint distribution, the optimal steps can be selected for exploitation. To support adaptive computation allocation, we propose in-width and in-depth pruning strategies, featuring a light-weight solution to achieve inference efficiency. Extensive experiments across seven benchmarks show ϕ-Decoding outperforms strong baselines in both performance and efficiency. Additional analysis demonstrates its generalization across various LLMs and scalability across a wide range of computing budgets. The code will be released at [this https URL](https://github.com/xufangzhi/phi-Decoding), and the open-source PyPI package is coming soon."

https://www.bitsaboutmoney.com/archive/community-banking-and-fintech/ "The part most relevant to technologists, however, is that the Durbin exemption for small financial institutions makes debit cards very lucrative if _and only if_ they are issued by a small financial institution.

Think of a fintech company with a debit card. Square’s Cash App. Chime. Robinhood. [Stripe Issuing](https://stripe.com/issuing), and users like [Ramp](https://ramp.com/) and [Bench](https://bench.co/). All of them, virtually without exemption, are brought to you courtesy of a small financial institution that you are unlikely to have heard of (unless you work in fintech or read Terms and Conditions for fun). Durbin exempt interchange is the revenue model which got a thousand pitch decks funded, because it is free to the ultimate consumer and protected by a moat guaranteed (for the moment) by Uncle Sam, contingent on the consumer choosing to use your app’s card." This let a generation of those apps compete on user experience without being crushed by large banks' pricing power. Customer acquisition for fintechs would be difficult if you could walk into any of the top ten banks and walk out with a 1% rewards debit card (which previously existed but don't anymore at large institutions, due to the Durbin amendment capping their revenue substantially lower than that)." https://www.stonecastle.com/ https://soundcloud.com/barretschoolofbanking/greatest-hits-track-1-richwood-bank-and-a-cup-of-coffee

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_data_analysis "**Functional data analysis** (FDA) is a branch of [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") that analyses data providing information about curves, surfaces or anything else varying over a continuum. In its most general form, under an FDA framework, each sample element of functional data is considered to be a random function. The physical continuum over which these functions are defined is often time, but may also be spatial location, wavelength, probability, etc. Intrinsically, functional data are infinite dimensional. The high intrinsic dimensionality of these data brings challenges for theory as well as computation, where these challenges vary with how the functional data were sampled. However, the high or infinite dimensional structure of the data is a rich source of information and there are many interesting challenges for research and data analysis." https://anson.ucdavis.edu/~mueller/Review151106.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping  https://dynamictimewarping.github.io/ "The packages [**dtw**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=dtw) for R and [**dtw-python**](https://pypi.org/project/dtw-python/) for Python provide the most complete, freely-available (GPL) implementation of Dynamic Time Warping-type (DTW) algorithms up to date. They support arbitrary local (eg symmetric, asymmetric, slope-limited) and global (windowing) constraints, fast native code, several plot styles, and more." https://gravitino.github.io/cudadtw/ https://tslearn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#
