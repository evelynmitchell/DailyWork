https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14499 Measuring AI Ability to Complete Long Tasks Despite rapid progress on AI benchmarks, the real-world meaning of benchmark performance remains unclear. To quantify the capabilities of AI systems in terms of human capabilities, we propose a new metric: 50%-task-completion time horizon. This is the time humans typically take to complete tasks that AI models can complete with 50% success rate. We first timed humans with relevant domain expertise on a combination of RE-Bench, HCAST, and 66 novel shorter tasks. On these tasks, current frontier AI models such as Claude 3.7 Sonnet have a 50% time horizon of around 50 minutes. Furthermore, frontier AI time horizon has been doubling approximately every seven months since 2019, though the trend may have accelerated in 2024. The increase in AI models' time horizons seems to be primarily driven by greater reliability and ability to adapt to mistakes, combined with better logical reasoning and tool use capabilities. We discuss the limitations of our results -- including their degree of external validity -- and the implications of increased autonomy for dangerous capabilities. If these results generalize to real-world software tasks, extrapolation of this trend predicts that within 5 years, AI systems will be capable of automating many software tasks that currently take humans a month.

It is created to achieve fine-grained resource sharing for various workloads efficiently on a large scale, multi-tenant, and cloud-native environment. YuniKorn brings a unified, cross-platform, scheduling experience for mixed workloads that consist of stateless batch workloads and stateful services.

YuniKorn now supports K8s and can be deployed as a custom K8s scheduler. YuniKorn's architecture design also allows adding different shim layer and adopt to different ResourceManager implementation including Apache Hadoop YARN, or any other systems."

https://github.com/khalil-research/PyEPO This repository is the official implementation of the paper: PyEPO: A PyTorch-based End-to-End Predict-then-Optimize Library for Linear and Integer Programming (Accepted to Mathematical Programming Computation (MPC)) "`PyEPO` (PyTorch-based End-to-End Predict-then-Optimize Tool) is a Python-based, open-source software that supports modeling and solving predict-then-optimize problems with the linear objective function. The core capability of `PyEPO` is to build optimization models with [GurobiPy](https://www.gurobi.com/), [Pyomo](http://www.pyomo.org/), [MPAX](https://github.com/MIT-Lu-Lab/MPAX) or any other solvers and algorithms, then embed the optimization model into an artificial neural network for the end-to-end training. For this purpose, `PyEPO` implements various methods as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) autograd modules." #optimization #pytorch
