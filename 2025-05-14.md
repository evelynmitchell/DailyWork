https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07215  #evals Measuring General Intelligence with Generated Games "We present gg-bench, a collection of game environments designed to evaluate general reasoning capabilities in language models. Unlike most static benchmarks, gg-bench is a data generating process where new evaluation instances can be generated at will. In particular, gg-bench is synthetically generated by (1) using a large language model (LLM) to generate natural language descriptions of novel games, (2) using the LLM to implement each game in code as a Gym environment, and (3) training reinforcement learning (RL) agents via self-play on the generated games. We evaluate language models by their winrate against these RL agents by prompting models with the game description, current board state, and a list of valid moves, after which models output the moves they wish to take. gg-bench is challenging: state-of-the-art LLMs such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieve winrates of 7-9% on gg-bench using in-context learning, while reasoning models such as o1, o3-mini and DeepSeek-R1 achieve average winrates of 31-36%. We release the generated games, data generation process, and evaluation code in order to support future modeling work and expansion of our benchmark." https://github.com/vivek3141/gg-bench

must provide a mechanism for automatically assessing generated solutions. This mechanism
takes the form of a function ℎ mapping a solution to a set of scalar evaluation metrics. By
convention, these metrics are maximized" "

Comment: No details on compute budget. Likely very high. Needs a scalar objective set
