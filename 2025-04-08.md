# agent prompts

Here's what works: Before opening your laptop, ask: 1. Industry patterns: - Who's winning? Why? - What's changing? Why now? 2. Company patterns: - Where do we win/lose? - What actually drives growth? 3. User patterns: - What problems persist? - What behaviors are changing?
https://x.com/nurijanian/status/1909667880691810321
Start small: Pick one upcoming decision and ask: 1. What game are we playing? 2. What patterns matter? 3. What would change everything? 4. What's the real constraint? Document your answers. Review in 90 days. That's how pattern recognition grows.

Focus on risks relevant to my side of the contract 2. Highlight hidden obligations or commitments 3. Flag any unusual termination or liability terms 4. Identify missing protective clauses 5. Note vague terms that need clarification 6. Compare against industry standards 7. Suggest specific improvements for negotiation If any section needs particular attention based on my role (customer/vendor/etc.), emphasize those aspects in your analysis. Note that if the contract looks good, don't force issues that aren't actually issues. --- This is not legal advice — always consult a lawyer!
