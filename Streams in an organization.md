The rough categories are: Money, Time, Data, Contracts and People.

Money directs attention and provides an unfakeable signal from the world. It is both transactional and how we measure stores of value, as streams of income and as salable assets.

Time, is both a constraint, in that events have a duration, and also an order, of before or after. It is a global coordination function that is now. It is larger on either direction. One direction, the future, has higher uncertainty, than the past. The stories we tell about the past can be modified to direct attention in the present and the future in different ways. When the stories change, the past has changed.

Data is all the information the world presents to our sensors. We use data to know what state we are in. Some of the data is private to our internal state. 

Contracts are the promises we have created, both internal and external. Promises have a duration, a cost, a consideration, and a performance. The performance of a contract is the state of the world that will come to be by the signatories. The consideration is what will be exchanged to bring about the performance. The duration is for how long the contract will be in force. The cost of the contract on the side of the purchasor is the consideration. The cost of the contract on the side of the provider is an internal process expense. The difference between the consideration and the internal process expense, is profit. Organizations are continually optimizing to both meet their contracts and reduce the internal process expense to do so. This optimization arises out of learning, technology, vendor contracts and scale.

People are the originators of the organization. They create a vision of how the world may be different. A mission to accomplish that change. A specific strategy on how to achieve the mission. Tactics to perform the mission in the real world at a specific time and place. They create policies to guide decisions. Workflows and processes to reduce decisions and variance. They problem solve and debug. They create. They negotiate. They persuade. They are the general purpose integrators.
