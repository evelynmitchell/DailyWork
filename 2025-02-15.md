# agent prompts

I need your help in constructing and verifying a mathematical proof. Here is the problem: Compute and simplify the tensor product of $Q/Z$ with itself (rationals modulo integers). Please approach this task with extreme rigor and careful attention to detail, following these specific guidelines: 0. PRELIMINARIES - Before starting the proof, list all relevant definitions and properties 1. CREATIVE STEPS - Think through creative ways to approach the result 2. PROOF STRUCTURE - Present a high-level outline of the proof strategy - Break down the proof into logical steps - For each step, state what you aim to establish about the lattice operations 3. DETAILED PROOF CONSTRUCTION For each step in your proof: - State the claim being proved - Show all lattice manipulations explicitly - Justify each manipulation with reference to specific lattice properties - Verify that all conditions for applying lattice laws are met - Check that operations are well-defined even in infinite lattices 4. VERIFICATION REQUIREMENTS After each significant step: - Verify that all graph elements are properly quantified - Confirm that all lattice expressions are well-defined - Check that assumptions about distributivity are used correctly - Verify that no circular reasoning is present - Ensure all possible path/cut configurations are covered 5. SPECIFIC TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS - Pay special attention to: * The properties of tensor products * The quotient Q/Z 6. FINAL VERIFICATION After completing the proof: - Review all steps for logical gaps - Verify that the conclusion follows from the chain of reasoning - Check that all assumptions were necessary and sufficient - Verify that the proof handles infinite lattices correctly 7. PRINT VERSION - When completed, rewrite the proof from start to finish, with steps - Write in the clear yet compact style of a mathematics research journal Please proceed step-by-step, showing all work explicitly. After each significant step, pause to verify its correctness before proceeding. If you encounter any potential issues or need clarification, state them explicitly.

Please build a prompt using the following guidelines: Define the Objective: - Clearly state the main research question or task. - Specify the desired outcome (e.g., detailed analysis, comparison, recommendations). Gather Context and Background: - Include all relevant background information, definitions, and data. - Specify any boundaries (e.g., scope, timeframes, geographic limits). Use Specific and Clear Language: - Provide precise wording and define key terms. - Avoid vague or ambiguous language. Provide Step-by-Step Guidance: - Break the task into sequential steps or sub-tasks. - Organize instructions using bullet points or numbered lists. Specify the Desired Output Format: - Describe how the final answer should be organized (e.g., report format, headings, bullet points, citations). Include any specific formatting requirements. Balance Detail with Flexibility: - Offer sufficient detail to guide the response while allowing room for creative elaboration. - Avoid over-constraining the prompt to enable exploration of relevant nuances. Incorporate Iterative Refinement: - Build in a process to test the prompt and refine it based on initial outputs. - Allow for follow-up instructions to adjust or expand the response as needed. Apply Proven Techniques: - Use methods such as chain-of-thought prompting (e.g., “think step by step”) for complex tasks. - Encourage the AI to break down problems into intermediate reasoning steps. Set a Role or Perspective: - Assign a specific role (e.g., “act as a market analyst” or “assume the perspective of a historian”) to tailor the tone and depth of the analysis. Avoid Overloading the Prompt: - Focus on one primary objective or break multiple questions into separate parts. - Prevent overwhelming the prompt with too many distinct questions. Request Justification and References: - Instruct the AI to support its claims with evidence or to reference sources where possible. - Enhance the credibility and verifiability of the response. Review and Edit Thoroughly: - Ensure the final prompt is clear, logically organized, and complete. - Remove any ambiguous or redundant instructions.
