https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02191 Understanding and Predicting Derailment in Toxic Conversations on GitHub "Software projects thrive on the involvement and contributions of individuals from different backgrounds. However, toxic language and negative interactions can hinder the participation and retention of contributors and alienate newcomers. Proactive moderation strategies aim to prevent toxicity from occurring by addressing conversations that have derailed from their intended purpose. This study aims to understand and predict conversational derailment leading to toxicity on GitHub.  
To facilitate this research, we curate a novel dataset comprising 202 toxic conversations from GitHub with annotated derailment points, along with 696 non-toxic conversations as a baseline. Based on this dataset, we identify unique characteristics of toxic conversations and derailment points, including linguistic markers such as second-person pronouns, negation terms, and tones of Bitter Frustration and Impatience, as well as patterns in conversational dynamics between project contributors and external participants.  
Leveraging these empirical observations, we propose a proactive moderation approach to automatically detect and address potentially harmful conversations before escalation. By utilizing modern LLMs, we develop a conversation trajectory summary technique that captures the evolution of discussions and identifies early signs of derailment. Our experiments demonstrate that LLM prompts tailored to provide summaries of GitHub conversations achieve 69% F1-Score in predicting conversational derailment, strongly improving over a set of baseline approaches." https://github.com/imranraad07/derailment-oss-replication ![[Screenshot from 2025-03-08 06-59-31.png]]
