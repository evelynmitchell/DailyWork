Epanechnikov kernel  and RKHS kernels
'The Epanechnikov kernel and kernels in Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) are both used in statistical methods, but they serve different purposes. The Epanechnikov kernel is a specific type of kernel function, known for its optimality in kernel density estimation, while RKHS kernels define inner products in transformed feature spaces, enabling linear methods to be applied to non-linear problems.

RKHS Kernels:

- Definition: An RKHS kernel, K(x, y), is a symmetric, positive definite function that defines an inner product in a transformed feature space. [[1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [13](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/statml/lectures/RKHSnotes.pdf#:~:text=A%20RKHS%20is%20defined%20by%20a%20Mercer,Z%20Z%20K\(x%2C%20y\)f\(x\)f\(y\)dx%20dy%20%E2%89%A5%200.), [13](https://www.stat.cmu.edu/~ryantibs/statml/lectures/RKHSnotes.pdf#:~:text=A%20RKHS%20is%20defined%20by%20a%20Mercer,Z%20Z%20K\(x%2C%20y\)f\(x\)f\(y\)dx%20dy%20%E2%89%A5%200.)]
- Purpose: RKHS kernels allow us to implicitly work in higher-dimensional feature spaces without explicitly calculating the transformations. [[1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf)]
- Functionality: They enable the application of linear methods (like linear regression) to non-linear problems by mapping data into a higher-dimensional space where linear techniques become applicable. [[1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf)]
- Example: If you have a feature mapping Ï†(x) that transforms your data into a higher-dimensional space, the kernel function K(x, y) = &lt;Ï†(x), Ï†(y)&gt; (where &lt;,&gt; is the inner product) can be used to calculate inner products in that space. [[1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [14](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249607000375#:~:text=The%20function%20%E2%89%94%20k%20\(%20x%20%2C,inner%20products%20in%20higher%20dimensional%20linearization%20spaces.), [15](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1051200422004997#:~:text=The%20kernel%20function%20derives%20a%20nonlinear%20mapping,\)%20represents%20the%20calculation%20of%20kernel%20function.)]
- Relationship to RKHS: RKHS kernels define the inner product within a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), which is a Hilbert space of functions defined on the original input space. [[1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [16](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume16/jorgensen15a/jorgensen15a.pdf#:~:text=Department%20of%20Mathematics%2C%20Informatics%2C%20and%20Cybersecurity%20Trine,ous%20with%20respect%20to%20the%20%D0%96%20%2Dnorm.), [16](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume16/jorgensen15a/jorgensen15a.pdf#:~:text=Department%20of%20Mathematics%2C%20Informatics%2C%20and%20Cybersecurity%20Trine,ous%20with%20respect%20to%20the%20%D0%96%20%2Dnorm.)]

Key Differences and Connections: [[1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [2](https://glossary.slb.com/terms/e/epanechnikov_kernel#:~:text=A%20discontinuous%20parabola%20kernel%20that%20is%20used,bump%20or%20cluster%20of%20data%20under%20scrutiny.), [3](https://blog.devgenius.io/from-rkhs-to-nonlinear-svm-unlocking-the-power-of-kernel-methods-in-machine-learning-1002032b5815#:~:text=The%20kernel%20function%20calculates%20inner%20products%20in,by%20enabling%20linear%20techniques%20in%20higher%2Ddimensional%20spaces.)]

- The Epanechnikov kernel is a specific kernel function used for a particular statistical task (KDE), while RKHS kernels are a more general concept applicable to a wider range of statistical and machine learning problems. [[1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [2](https://glossary.slb.com/terms/e/epanechnikov_kernel#:~:text=A%20discontinuous%20parabola%20kernel%20that%20is%20used,bump%20or%20cluster%20of%20data%20under%20scrutiny.), [3](https://blog.devgenius.io/from-rkhs-to-nonlinear-svm-unlocking-the-power-of-kernel-methods-in-machine-learning-1002032b5815#:~:text=The%20kernel%20function%20calculates%20inner%20products%20in,by%20enabling%20linear%20techniques%20in%20higher%2Ddimensional%20spaces.), [8](https://www.stata.com/manuals13/rkdensity.pdf#:~:text=kdensity%20includes%20seven%20different%20kernel%20functions.%20The,and%20n%20is%20the%20number%20of%20observations.), [12](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/kernel-density-estimation-explained-step-by-step-7cc5b5bc4517#:~:text=KDE%20is%20a%20composite%20function%20made%20up,are%20summed%20to%20form%20the%20KDE%20.)]
- RKHS kernels are fundamentally tied to the concept of Hilbert spaces and feature spaces, while the Epanechnikov kernel is often discussed in the context of probability density estimation. [[1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [2](https://glossary.slb.com/terms/e/epanechnikov_kernel#:~:text=A%20discontinuous%20parabola%20kernel%20that%20is%20used,bump%20or%20cluster%20of%20data%20under%20scrutiny.), [3](https://blog.devgenius.io/from-rkhs-to-nonlinear-svm-unlocking-the-power-of-kernel-methods-in-machine-learning-1002032b5815#:~:text=The%20kernel%20function%20calculates%20inner%20products%20in,by%20enabling%20linear%20techniques%20in%20higher%2Ddimensional%20spaces.), [16](https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume16/jorgensen15a/jorgensen15a.pdf#:~:text=Department%20of%20Mathematics%2C%20Informatics%2C%20and%20Cybersecurity%20Trine,ous%20with%20respect%20to%20the%20%D0%96%20%2Dnorm.), [17](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproducing_kernel_Hilbert_space), [18](https://observablehq.com/@ericmauviere/plot-epanechnikov#:~:text=Plot%20&%20Epanechnikov%20From%20Kernel%20density%20estimation:,%22kernel%20method%22%2C%20here%20with%20an%20Epanechnikov%20kernel.)]
- The Epanechnikov kernel can be used as an example of a kernel function within the broader RKHS framework. [[1](https://www.gatsby.ucl.ac.uk/~gretton/coursefiles/lecture4_introToRKHS.pdf), [19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_\(statistics\))]
- While the Epanechnikov kernel is known for its optimality in KDE, the choice of RKHS kernel can be more flexible and dependent on the specific problem and data. [[4](https://johndellarosa.github.io/projects/distribution-book/kde), [8](https://www.stata.com/manuals13/rkdensity.pdf#:~:text=kdensity%20includes%20seven%20different%20kernel%20functions.%20The,and%20n%20is%20the%20number%20of%20observations.), [20](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/187678/different-definitions-of-epanechnikov-kernel), [21](https://medium.com/@evertongomede/kernel-methods-for-machine-learning-7ce29319a9e4#:~:text=Flexibility:%20The%20choice%20of%20kernel%20function%20allows,hand%2C%20ensuring%20adaptability%20to%20different%20data%20types.)]

#solver "There aren't that many SMT solvers, but amongst the "industrial strength" solvers Z3 is the second best.
The best solver is CVC5 and usually by a significant margin (though this also depends on what exactly you are doing...).
The final "competitor" is OpenCog, but that is only really relevant for probabilistic logic and relational models (it can technically do more, but you start suffering)
The interface of Z3 used to be a distinguishing characteristic, but other solvers have caught up quite a bit (e.g. cvc5 uses the same python api, and the C++ api of cvc5 is just better).

In general, from a performance POV, cvc5 is the standard to beat."" ZickZack

https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13657v2 Why Do Multi-Agent LLM Systems Fail? "Despite growing enthusiasm for Multi-Agent LLM Systems (MAS), their performance gains on popular benchmarks often remain minimal compared with single-agent frameworks. This gap highlights the need to systematically analyze the challenges hindering MAS effectiveness.  
We present MAST (Multi-Agent System Failure Taxonomy), the first empirically grounded taxonomy designed to understand MAS failures. We analyze seven popular MAS frameworks across over 200 tasks, involving six expert human annotators. Through this process, we identify 14 unique failure modes, organized into 3 overarching categories, (i) specification issues, (ii) inter-agent misalignment, and (iii) task verification. MAST emerges iteratively from rigorous inter-annotator agreement studies, achieving a Cohen's Kappa score of 0.88. To support scalable evaluation, we develop a validated LLM-as-a-Judge pipeline integrated with MAST. We leverage two case studies to demonstrate MAST's practical utility in analyzing failures and guiding MAS development. Our findings reveal that identified failures require more complex solutions, highlighting a clear roadmap for future research. We open source our comprehensive dataset and LLM annotator to facilitate further development of MAS" https://github.com/multi-agent-systems-failure-taxonomy/MAST

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa **Cohen's kappa coefficient** ('Îº', lowercase Greek [kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kappa "Kappa")) is a [statistic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistic "Statistic") that is used to measure [inter-rater reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability "Inter-rater reliability") (and also [intra-rater reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intra-rater_reliability "Intra-rater reliability")) for qualitative (categorical) items.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa#cite_note-Mary2012-1) It is generally thought to be a more robust measure than simple percent agreement calculation, as Îº takes into account the possibility of the agreement occurring by chance. There is controversy surrounding Cohen's kappa due to the difficulty in interpreting indices of agreement. Some researchers have suggested that it is conceptually simpler to evaluate disagreement between items.[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa#cite_note-:0-2)  -- **Scott's pi** (named after [William A Scott](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_A._Scott_\(psychologist\) "William A. Scott (psychologist)")) is a statistic for measuring [inter-rater reliability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability "Inter-rater reliability") for [nominal data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_data "Nominal data") in [communication studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_studies "Communication studies"). Textual entities are annotated with categories by different annotators, and various measures are used to assess the extent of agreement between the annotators, one of which is Scott's pi. Since automatically annotating text is a popular problem in [natural language processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing "Natural language processing"), and the goal is to get the computer program that is being developed to agree with the humans in the annotations it creates, assessing the extent to which humans agree with each other is important for establishing a reasonable upper limit on computer performance.
-- **Fleiss' kappa** (named after [Joseph L. Fleiss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_L._Fleiss "Joseph L. Fleiss")) is a [statistical measure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_measure "Statistical measure") for assessing the [reliability of agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inter-rater_reliability "Inter-rater reliability") between a fixed number of [raters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rater "Rater") when assigning [categorical ratings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_rating "Categorical rating") to a number of items or classifying items. This contrasts with other kappas such as [Cohen's kappa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_kappa "Cohen's kappa"), which only work when assessing the agreement between not more than two raters or the intra-rater reliability (for one appraiser versus themself). The measure calculates the degree of agreement in classification over that which would be expected by chance. --**Youden's J statistic** (also called **Youden's index**) is a single statistic that captures the performance of a [dichotomous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dichotomy "Dichotomy") diagnostic test. In [meteorology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology "Meteorology"), this statistic is referred to as **Peirce Skill Score (PSS)**, **Hanssenâ€“Kuipers Discriminant (HKD)**, or **True Skill Statistic (TSS)**.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youden%27s_J_statistic#cite_note-1)
