# agent prompts

I create content about [YOUR SUBJECT OR NICHE HERE]. I want you to perform thorough, in-depth research on this niche by analyzing its common pain points, the root causes of those problems, and the types of solutions that exist (if any). 1. Identify Key Challenges: • Provide me with 5 major challenges that people in my niche frequently encounter. • Explain each challenge in detail, focusing on: • Why it occurs • Who is most impacted • What current (if any) solutions or workarounds exist 2. Propose Software Solutions: • For each of the 5 challenges, propose one unique software idea that could solve or significantly reduce that challenge. • Break each software idea down into: • Core Functionality: What does it do? How does it address the challenge directly? • Key Features: List 3–5 critical features that make it stand out from existing solutions. • Value Proposition: Clearly explain how it benefits users, saves time/money, or simplifies tasks compared to other tools on the market. • Potential Tech Stack / Implementation Notes: If applicable, suggest frameworks, languages, or libraries that might be well-suited to build this solution. 3. Cite Sources & Data Points (If Available): • If you refer to any statistics, facts, or expert opinions, please provide references (studies, articles, or credible sources) to support the claim or finding. 4. Conclusion & Next Steps: • Summarize why these challenges are significant. • Emphasize how the proposed software ideas could disrupt or advance the niche. • Suggest any further reading or research paths that could help refine these software concepts. • Give me a detailed action plan on how I can get started building these ideas with Cursor. Act as if I have no programming experience. At the end of your response, provide a concise action plan or checklist summarizing how to go from idea to product validation.
